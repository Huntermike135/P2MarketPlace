# This enables the Spring Boot actuator via the web. The Spring Boot actuator
# provides developers with application metrics and health checks. It is essentially
# a monitoring tool. Note that by default you cannot access a lot of the endpoints
# that the actuator exposes via the web; these are only accessible via a tool called
# JMX. Note that you should never really expose all of the actuator like this because
# it's not.
